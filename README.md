<b>About:</b>
Andromeda One, also known as FIRST Team 4905, is a robotics team from Ayer Shirley Regional High School in Ayer, MA. The team was launched in the fall of 2013 by our team leader Christine Miska. Our team is currently made up of 23 students and 20 mentors.

We would like to thank our sponsors for their incredible support and our amazing mentors for their knowledge, patience, and enthusiasm in helping us in the 2014 season.

The FIRST Robotics Competition challenges teams of young people and their mentors to solve a common problem in a six-week time frame using a standard “kit of parts” and a common set of rules. Teams design, build, and program robots and enter them in a series of competitions designed by Dean Kamen, Dr. Woodie Flowers, and a committee of engineers and other professionals in multiple locations.

<b>Team Name</b>
Team members voted from a list of different names and they chose to call the team AndromedaOne. The name was thought of and based off of the Andromeda galaxy in space.
